            Unfortinutly, personality tests have been proven to not be statistacly relevent.
            In fact, the only statistically relavant test avaliable in 2020 which can lend
            itself to gaging life "placement" is an IQ test. All other tests have been
            proven to not provied reliable results.

            There are times in life that are hard. There are time in life where you may
            feel like a spinning Rubiks Cube with a perpetual, Who am I, running in your head.
            That's good. At least you are taking stock of where you are at.</br> Life goes on and people change and evolve. The reason that you
            may not know who you are right now is because you are in the proces of becoming someone new.
            Most people grow to an age where they understand the bagage that they may carry from their
            childhood or past. Yet, only a few people live to the age of comprehension that once you are an
            adult you get to decide which of that baggage you continue to carry with you. </br>
            You're doing great. You are ehough. You can be whoever you are willing to work to be.
            Do you Boo Boo and have a great rest of your time at OSU.
