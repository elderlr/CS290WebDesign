        <h3>The IBMs of the word</h3>
        <p>
            The brilliance of this group is offten overrated. Does it take more skill to grill a hamburger
            than it does a Kraby Patty? I think not. This group is a relatively new group that has been
            dominated by mid to younger level caree levels. Due to their early inception the IBMs of the
            world have yet to come into their own as a group. Look below to scroll through all of the letters in this group.

        <h3>The PGYs of the word</h3>
        <p>
            This group is a straight line type of group. More of your Blue Collar at heart group. Willing
            to stand up for what they belive in with a board straight back. They might apear to be <u>too</u>
            straight but look closser and you will see their curzes and twists.

        <p>
            No one is better at bridging the gap and reaching accross the line than the HNRs. Just
            look at thier shape!. The HNRs always find a way to conect the dots and bring people and companies together.

        <h3>The Q-CUZ of the word</h3>
        <p>
            This group is lively. They are the type to press the pedal to the floorboard and... run
            right into a wall. Unfortanitly they apreach the world as if it is a round race track,
            clear of obsticles. As you can see, that is hardly the case with these letters. They all have unexpected ends and turns.

        <h3>The FKSXs of the word</h3>
        <p>
            The FKSXs do not give a flying piggy. They are sharp and quick to voice their opinoins.
            Make no mistake if you are in the presence of a FKSX you will know where you stand with
            them; they'll tell you. Interestingly enough most FKSX live in areas of colder weather and are of taller than average height.
